# Sucuri
Python Dataflow Programming Library

Read the examples and the referenced papers as I do not have a written tutorial (yet).


This is the current repository for Sucuri, it supports both python 2.7.x and python 3.x.

A completely new version with hierarchical distributed scheduling is on its way.
